<!-- Text Elements-
  To work on the small parts of the text, we use the text elements such as <strong> to 
  make text bold, <u> to underline. 
  And <span> ,the most generic, which has no styles so we can use class in it and do styling 
  according to our convinience.
-->

<!--
  CSS Specificity-
  Here, we are styling margin bottom in both selectors "p" and video-title/stat/etc
  but the one which would be having priority will be the one which is more specific,
  And in this case, classes (being more specific) have more priority than the p selector.

  class name selector >>> element name selector
