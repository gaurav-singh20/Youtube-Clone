  DISPLAY PROPERTY
  the image and text box are on the same line but the paragraphs are acuiring the whole line
  and are on different lines. this is because of the display property

  3 Types of elements in HTML-
  
  1. block element- regardless of the size they take up,they anyway takes the entire line e.g <p> tag.
  2. inline-block element- only takes up as much space as needed.
  3. inline element- text elements that appear within a line of text

  TO SWITCH BETWEEN BLOCK AND INLINE BLOCK, WE USE DISPLAY PROPERTY OF CSS.
  DISPLAY ELEMENTS CAN'T BE CENTERED.
